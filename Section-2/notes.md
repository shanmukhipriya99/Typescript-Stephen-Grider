## Types in Typescript

*Type:* is an easy way to refer to the different props + functions that a value has.

**Types**:
- **Primitive Types**: 
  - number
  - boolean
  - void
  - null
  - undefined
  - string
  - symbol, etc
- **Object Types**:
  - functions
  - arrays
  - classes
  - objects

### Why do we care about *types*?
- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
- Type allow other engineers to understnd what values are flowing around our codebase.
